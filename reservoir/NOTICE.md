# Reservoir analysis — authors, references and licensing

The code in this folder is a JavaScript port of **BPplus-Reservoir**
(`bpp_Res2`, beta7): MATLAB scripts that perform pulse wave analysis,
reservoir–excess pressure analysis and pressure-only wave intensity analysis on
BP+ measurements.

## Authors of the original

## Where this port departs from beta7

Defects in beta7 that change a value or a figure are corrected here, each
listed in `CORRECTIONS` in `reservoir.js` so a user interface can show them, and
each reported upstream. `analyseReservoir(input, { compatibility: 'beta7' })`
reproduces the original, with one exception: the diastolic R² is computed only
when more than 10 samples remain, as proposed in adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#45.

- **Diastolic duration** (`re_aodd`) is 60/HR less the ejection duration. beta7
  subtracts the end-systolic pressure divided by 1000 (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#25).
- **The SEVR figure** ends systole at the ejection duration, where the SEVR
  value does. beta7 reuses a variable the wave intensity section has
  overwritten, so its figure ends systole at the minimum of that section's
  derivative instead (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#27).
- **The pulse traces figure** shows the pulses in `sSelectedPulseIndexes`.
  beta7 draws the first N−1 pulses of the recording, N being the number
  selected, so rejected pulses can appear and selected ones be missing
  (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#28).
- **The T1 label on the SEVR figure** is placed at the inflection sample.
  beta7 indexes the beat with `ao_Ti*samplerate`, which is `ti/fs*fs` and not
  always an integer in floating point, so on some recordings — at 200 Hz, an
  inflection at sample 7, 14, 28 or 29, among others — it stops with "Array
  indices must be positive integers" before writing any results (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#30).

Behaviour kept as beta7 has it — reported upstream, but not changed here,
because changing it changes results that are the original authors' to define:

- The beat is cut after its last falling sample before the reservoir fit, but
  the fit's time axis spans the uncut beat, so its sample interval is slightly
  longer than 1/fs. The ejection duration, rate constants, SEVR split and Ew
  inherit this (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#26).
- The pressure-time integrals (`re_ao_tti`, `re_ao_dti`) are summed over
  samples, not seconds, and leave out one interval. Interfaces should label
  them mmHg·sample (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#33).
- The time of Wf2 (`re_wf2t`) is one sample later than the peak it reports:
  the search window's offset is added to a 1-based position (adh30/BPplus-Reservoir#32).

## Status

A research analysis, not a result of the BP+ and not for diagnosis. Values are
checked against the MATLAB original run on the same measurements — see
https://github.com/doingnz/bpplus-reservoir-vectors.
